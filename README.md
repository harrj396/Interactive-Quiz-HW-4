# Interactive Quiz Homework 4

## Description

This project focuses on applying knowledge on querySelector and local storage to create a quiz based on coding knowledge.  I found myself severely struggling on this project.  I was overwhelmed with having to create everything from scratch, and I didn't practice enough to be able to follow the pseudocode provided.  I had help with a TA to help try and figure out what was exactly holding me up, and we came to the conclusion that I was confusing multiple subjects together.  With this insight I'm going to be going over and reverse engineering the classwork to learn each idea better.
